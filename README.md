# SQL

Hello, and welcome. 

The following repository contains my work with database management system using mySQL. Aside from mysql code, you can expect to find database design & data modelling, ER Diagrams, DDL and DML.  

Assignment 1: You're the database architect at Ministry of Health Canada, which has given you the task of designing a database which accurately records and efficiently retrieves information about health care entities and thier interactions in the hospital setting. 
- Database design, data modelling, ER diagram, and DDL.

To run the DDL file, you need access to a DBMS, in which you pipe the script and then use the command SHOW TABLES; to see them all. 

Assignment 2: Given a data-base of the Canadian Hospitals, a medium to large dataset, preform data analysis in SQL. Then, convert a few selected queries to Relational Algebra.
